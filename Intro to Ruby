Competencies

Created by Yukihiro Matsumoto, emphasize human understanding
Ruby is an object-oriented language
Objects are “things” that contain data, have properties(attributes), and can perform methods
Variables are placeholders for data(info)
Ruby supports different data types: strings, integers, booleans, symbols, arrays, and hashes
Strings are “words”
Integers are numbers
Booleans are True/False
Symbols are like placeholders for strings, but use less memory
Arrays are collections of data
Hashes are key/value pairs of data
All these data types are objects, you are operate on all of them
Each element of a data type is “indexed” and you can access them individually
Indices start at 0










Applications

Make your own variables, in various different types. (eg. favorite_food = “pizza”, is_tall = false, pets = 2, etc)
Create arrays and hashes:  for example, rappers = [“Kanye”, “Jay-Z”, “Tupac”, “KDot”, “B.I.G”]
Pets = { “Spot” => “Dog”, “Whiskers” => “Cat”}
Operate on your created variables, for example, what is the third rapper in your list?
Say “Hello world!”
